# To-Do-List
This is a to do list application, hope you can enjoy while using it

## Update (05/15/2025)
Just found a small problem that the user can not exit immediately after choosing that option, I will fix it tomorrow but the application can still use it right now.

## Update (05/16/2025)
Problem is fixed now

## Update2 (05/16/2025)
So when I'm doing another project, I just realize that when the user add new things to the to do list, it will start to count back to 1 so I just fixed it, here are some new updates:
- Fixed the problem when user add new things in the already exist to do list it will count back to 1
- Create a file to store all the to do list files name that user created
- Let the user to see all the list that they created so far

 ## ‚≠ê Plans in the future:
 - Implement new features to check if the file is already exist or not
 - Let the user delete the files (send to trash or delete completely depends on the user)
 - Make it looks like a real application
 - publish it on pc
 - Publish it on phone (not sure about this yet)
